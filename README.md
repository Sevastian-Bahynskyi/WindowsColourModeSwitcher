# Windows Colour Mode Switcher

## Overview

Windows Colour Mode Switcher is a simple application that allows users to switch between light and dark themes on Windows.  
The application updates the system theme and provides a system tray icon for easy access.
> _NOTE:_ The application doesn't magically change the theme of all applications.  
> However, a lot of applications support the sync with system theme which means they will change their theme automatically when the Windows theme mode is changed.
> This way you can achieve a system-wide theme change with a single click.

## Features

- Switch between light and dark themes
- System tray icon with context menu
- Automatic icon update based on the selected theme
